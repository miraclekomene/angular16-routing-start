  Understanding the Example Project
  In our app, we got three sections:

  Home
  Servers
  View and Edit Servers
  A Service is used to load and update Servers
  Users
  View Users
  This app will be improved by adding routing but definitely feel free to play around with it - besides routing, everything should be working fine.
